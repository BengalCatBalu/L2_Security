# 🔍 L2 Security Checklists

A collection of security checklists for Layer 2 solutions, covering both **protocol architects** and **DApp developers** working with Rollups.

## 📑 Available Checklists

### 1️⃣ **Rollup Architecture Security Checklist**
For protocol designers building Layer 2 solutions (Optimistic Rollups, ZK-Rollups, etc.).
- Covers **state validation, fraud proofs, data availability, decentralization, sequencer risks, MEV, governance, and more**.
- Helps architects ensure security, resilience, and best practices in L2 implementations.

### 2️⃣ **DApp Developer Checklist for Rollups**
For developers building applications on Layer 2 solutions.
- Focuses on **cross-chain compatibility, signature replay risks, opcode inconsistencies, gas optimizations, RPC latency, and upgradeability**.
- Aims to prevent common pitfalls when deploying smart contracts on Rollups.

## 🧪 Code Samples & Verification Approach

Each checklist item is accompanied by **code samples** to illustrate how a given issue or concept can be technically validated:

- ✅ For **Rollup Architecture Checklist**, code snippets are **conceptual mockups**.  
  These are intentionally simplified Solidity examples designed to demonstrate **what to verify in the protocol design or audit**.  
  They help link theoretical security concerns with practical implementation details.

- ✅ For **DApp Developer Checklist**, code fragments are based on **real protocols** and include **excerpts from deployed contracts**, as well as **proof-of-concept examples** for known issues or misimplementations.

The goal is to make each checklist item **actionable and verifiable** — not just a list of concerns, but a tool for direct application in engineering and audit workflows.

## 📌 Usage
- Browse the checklists and integrate them into your development/audit workflows.
- Use as a reference for security best practices in L2 environments.
