A collection of security checklists for Layer 2 solutions, covering both **protocol architects** and **DApp developers** working with Rollups.

## 📑 Available Checklists

### 1️⃣ **Rollup Architecture Security Checklist**
For protocol designers building Layer 2 solutions (Optimistic Rollups, ZK-Rollups, etc.).
- Covers **state validation, fraud proofs, data availability, decentralization, sequencer risks, MEV, governance, and more**.
- Helps architects ensure security, resilience, and best practices in L2 implementations.

### 2️⃣ **DApp Developer Checklist for Rollups**
For developers building applications on Layer 2 solutions.
- Focuses on **cross-chain compatibility, signature replay risks, opcode inconsistencies, gas optimizations, RPC latency, and upgradeability**.
- Aims to prevent common pitfalls when deploying smart contracts on Rollups.

## 📌 Usage
- Browse the checklists and integrate them into your development/audit workflows.
- Use as a reference for security best practices in L2 environments.
